CREPL: An interactive REPL for C.
## Features:
- Auto-indentation when opening braces
- Modular command system (I encourage you to add your own! It requires no use of any functions of CREPL unless you wanna interact with it directly.)
- Buffer operations like saving, clearing and inspecting
## TODOs:
- Editing lines (a command, I'm thinking something like `Â§e lineno content` or using Vim.)

*I really don't have any ideas, I rely heavily on people's ideas lol.*
